# In Your Base

A personal, local-only browser for your own exported data. Drop in any
`.json` file and it detects the file type automatically — then search,
filter, tag, and read back through it, entirely on your own device.

## What it does

- **Detects the file type automatically.** ChatGPT and Claude.ai exports
  are read precisely; anything else falls back to a generic reader — an
  array of turns with a role-like field and a text-like field, under
  whatever names that export happens to use. What it can't confidently
  read, it skips rather than guesses at.
- **Searches and filters** by keyword, platform, date range, and your own
  tags. The platform filter isn't fixed to two values — it's built from
  whatever's actually present in what you've loaded.
- **Timeline** view of activity by month.
- **A search brief** — a written procedure meant to be handed to an AI
  assistant, describing how to work through a large personal data set
  deliberately (scope, catalog, flag, read, record) rather than skimming it.
- **An optional AI assistant** that runs that brief live, using an Anthropic
  API key you supply. Off by default; nothing is sent anywhere unless you
  turn it on. As it reads, it logs short quote-plus-note findings instead of
  holding full text in context — keeps token spend from climbing every
  round of a long search.

## Privacy

In Your Base is a single self-contained HTML file with no server behind it.
Everything it parses — your records, tags, saved brief — is written to
your browser's local storage on your device, and nothing is sent out over
the network, with one exception: if you set up the AI assistant, your
messages and API key go directly from your browser to `api.anthropic.com`.
No part of this app has a backend of its own, and nothing routes through
any server of ours.

What you load is tied to one browser, on one device — it doesn't sync.
There's no built-in export, so keep your original `.json` files;
re-importing them is how you'd rebuild it elsewhere.

## Usage

Download `index.html` and open it in a browser — double-click works, no
install or build step needed. The in-app **manual** button covers every
feature in detail once it's open.

## The hosted variant

[`hosted/`](hosted) is a clone of this same app with one change: instead of
each person pasting in their own Anthropic API key, the AI assistant is
gated by a passcode and routed through a small proxy (in [`worker/`](worker))
that holds a single shared key server-side, with hard per-person and
total spending caps enforced before any request goes out. Use this if you
want to give a few people access to the assistant without also giving them
your API key. See [`worker/README.md`](worker/README.md) to deploy the
proxy; the UI is otherwise identical to the plain version above.

## Installing on your phone

This app is installable as a PWA (Progressive Web App) once hosted somewhere
over `https://` — e.g. GitHub Pages. `manifest.json`, `sw.js`, and `icons/`
give it a name, an app icon, and a minimal offline shell cache so it behaves
like a real app on your home screen instead of just a bookmark.

1. Make sure this repo is public (Settings → Danger Zone → Change
   visibility), then enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from
   branch → `main` → `/` root).
2. Once it's live, open `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
   on your phone — not the repo's `github.com` page.
3. Use your browser's "Add to Home Screen" / "Install app" option.
